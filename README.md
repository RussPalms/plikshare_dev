## Hey Claude, how to pronounce it?
![claude_pronunciation](https://github.com/damian-krychowski/plikshare/blob/main/assets/how_to_pronounce.png)

I double-checked - he made no mistake this time. It's "pleek-share" (plÄ“k-shÃ¢r)!

Where "Plik" in ancient Polish means "file".

(Yeap, it's hard to find good domain name these times ðŸ¥²)
