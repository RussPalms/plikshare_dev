## Hey Claude, how to pronounce it?
![claude_pronunciation](https://github.com/damian-krychowski/plikshare/blob/main/assets/how_to_pronounce.png)

I double-checked - he made no mistake this time. It's "pleek-share" (plÄ“k-shÃ¢r)!

Where "Plik" in ancient Polish means "file".

(Yeap, it's hard to find good domain name these times ðŸ¥²)

## How to setup

To start using PlikShare you need to do two things: 
- Configure an email client (so that PlikShare can send notifications, confirm user emails etc.)

## How to upload files
The fastes way is to create zip archive out of the files you want to upload and them use PlikShare bulk upload feature!

## How to download files
My favorite way to download files from PlikShare is to use explorer tree view - there you pick files and folders you want to have in your final archive and download them at once.

## How to share files
PlikShare allows you to create "boxes" - a layer that connects your folders to the external world. These boxes give you control over how others interact with your selected folders. With boxes, you can:

- Invite team members to collaborate
- Create anonymous links with various permission levels
- Set up read-only boxes where others can only view content
- Create upload-only boxes where users can add files without seeing existing content

This structured approach provides a secure and flexible way to share your files while maintaining precise control over access permissions.
